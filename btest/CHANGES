  * A number of bug fixes, and output polishing. (Robin Sommer)

  * More robust background execution by btest-bg-*. (Robin Sommer)

0.22-4 | 2011-03-29 21:38:13 -0700

  * A test command can now signal to btest that even if it fails
    subsequent test commands should still run by returning exit code 100.
    btest-diff uses this to continue in the case that no baseline has
    yet been established.

  * New test option @TEST-REQUIRES for running a test conditionally.
    See the README for more information.

0.22-2 | 2011-03-03 21:44:18 -0800

  * Two new helper scripts for spawning processes in the background.
    See README for more information.

  * btest-diff can now deal with files specificied with paths.
    
0.22 | 2011-02-08 14:06:13 -0800

  * BTest is now hosted along with the other Bro repositories on
    git.bro-ids.org.

0.21 | 2011-01-09 21:29:18 -0800

  * In btest.cfg, option values can now include commands to execute in
    backticks.

    Example:
    
        [environment]
        CC=clang -emit-llvm -g `hilti-config --cflags`
    
  * Limiting substitutions to replacing whole words.

  * Adding "substitutions". Substitutions are similar to filters, yet
    they do not adapt the input but the command line being exectued.
    See README for more information.

  * Instead of giving a test's file name on the command line, one can
    now also use its "dotted" name as it's printed out when btest is
    running (e.g., "foo.bar"). That allows for easier copy/paste.

  * Starting CHANGES.
