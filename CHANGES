  * Fixes to make the Bro plugin work again with current Bro master.

  * A failing test case: currently when there is a list without a
    specified length in a unit which gets it data from a sink, there
    is no way to signal end-of-data and thus end the list without an
    exception.

  * When reassembling, one can now detach the sequence space from the
    length of the data, e.g., for reassembling by packet numbers. For
    that, sink.write() gets an additional optional parameter to pass
    in the length that the new chunk occupies inside the sequence
    space.
  * Adding a new operator for sinks to instantiate them dynamically.

  * Adding reassemly support to sinks.

  * Sinks now allow for out-of-order input by passing sequence numbers
    to write():

        export type Main = unit {

            var data : sink;

            on %init {
                self.data.connect(new Sub);
                self.data.write(b"567", 5);
                self.data.write(b"89", 8);
                self.data.write(b"012", 0);
                self.data.write(b"34", 3);
                self.data.close();
                }

        export type Sub = unit {
            s: bytes &eod;

            on %done {
                print self.s;
            }
        }

        # spicy-driver test.spicy
        0123456789

    These sequence numbers are optional; by default write() adds to the
    end of the stream, like before.

    Along with this come a few new sink methods:

        sink.set_initial_sequence_number(seq)
            Sets an initial sequence number. All other seq are relative
            to this. Defaults to zero.

        sink.set_data.set_policy(policy)
            Sets a policy how to handle ambigious input. Only one policy
            exists currently: take the oldest data.

        sink.set_data.set_policy(policy)
            Sets a policy how to handle ambigious input. Only one policy
            exists currently: take the oldest data.

        sink.sequence()
            Returns the sink's current sequence number.

        sink.gap(seq, len)
            Reports a gap of length len in the input stream at seq.

        sink.skip(seq)
            Skips ahead in the input stream. New data below seq will be
            ignored. Can move beyond gaps to continue processing.

        sink.trim(seq)
            Delete any still buffered data upt ot seq.

        sink.set_auto_trim(enabled)
            If enabled (whichis the default) all delivered data is
            automatically trimmed.

            TODO: In fact, one cannot disable auto-trim currently.

    There are also a few more sink hooks in this context:

        on %gap(seq: uint<64>, len: uint<64>) { ... }
            Triggered when the input stream reaches a gap.

        on %skip(seq: uint<64>) { ... }
            Triggered when a skip() methods skips ahead.

        on %undelivered(seq: uint<64>, data: bytes) { ... }
            Triggered for data that couldn't be put in sequence.

        on %overlap(seq: uint<64>, b1: bytes, b2: bytes) { ... }
            Triggered for ambigious input.

  * Changing output to enclose bytes instanced in b"..." when printing.

  * "Dynamic Format Detection" or Spicy::

    There's a new sink method try_connect_mime_type() that works
    mostly like connect_mime_type() but attaches all matching subunits
    in a new preliminary trial mode, assuming that it's not clear yet
    if the sink's input is indeed in their format. If in this mode a
    parse error occurs, that's internally treated as a soft error that
    just leads to the parser being disabled for the sink.

    There are a few additional pieces to that scheme:

        - unit.confirm() confirms that a unit is seeing the right stuff,
          disabling trial mode. This can only be called on a top-level
          unit; that's not that great, but unclear if it could be
          supported down in the parse tree (worst case is one will alsways
          need to pass it down).

        - unit.disable(msg) explicitly disables parsing, just as a parse
          error in trial mode would. If this happens inside a unit that is
          directly instantiated by a host application (i.e, not connected
          via sink), it will propagate as a ParserDisabled exception
          upstream.

        - the hook %confirmed() runs when unit.confirm() is called. This
          hook can only be defined in a top-level unit.

        - the hook %disabled() runs when a parser gets disabled, either
          via parse error in trial mode or explicitly via disable(). This
          hook can only be defined in a top-level unit.

        - If a unit connected with try_connect_mime_type() defines
          synchronization support, that's actviated first before the
          actual parsing proceeds. That can (1) be more effificient
          (e.g.., if it can quickly scan for a regexp, and (2) allows
          for parsing to start midstream once the synchronization has
          identified a suitable spot (this will allow, e.g., to
          reasonably parse partial connections). Once synchronization
          completes, the actual parsing will stay in trial mode, per
          the previous commit (i.e., we follow the 2-stage process of
          Bro's DPD here).

  * Adding two new Spicy library functions.

        bytes sha256(b: bytes, seed: bytes, out_len: int64);
        addr anonymize(a: addr, seed: int64);

  * Support for generating ("composing") binary data from a parsed
    instance.

    To test, spicy-driver got a new option -c that will let it turn a
    just parsed representation back into binary.

        export type test = unit {
           a: bytes &length=4;
           b: bytes &length=6;
        };

        # echo 1234567890 | spicy-driver -c bytes.spicy
        1234567890

    This further includes:

        - Composing bytes, integers, addresses, child units, lists
          with &count &until_including, &until [1]

                [1] &until needs manual support: as the terminating
                element doesn't exist anymore at compose time, it needs to
                be added back manully (we could instead save it
                internally, but then the user wouldn't be able to change
                it).

        - Adding syntax to mark fields as only for parsing or only for
          composing:

            export type test = unit {
                a  :  bytes &length=2;
                b1 <  int<16> &byteorder=Spicy::ByteOrder::Little;
                b1 >  int<16> &byteorder=Spicy::ByteOrder::Big;
                c  :  bytes &length=2;
            }

          Legend:
            ':' means "use this for parsing and composing"
            '<' means "use this for parsing only"
            '>' means "use this for composing only"

        - Fields with a &parse attribute are turned into "<" automatically.

        - Standard hook don't execute during composing. One can however or
          have compose-only hooks in addition:

            type Foo = unit {
                on %init !> { # Triggered just before composing this unit begins; }
                on %done !> { # Triggered just after composing this unit finished; }

                a: int32 !> { # Triggered just *before* composing this field begins; }

            Note that compose field hooks trigger before composing the
            fields, not after.

        - Fields with &convert attribute are problematic for composing as
          in general one can't automatically reverse that expression. We
          do this:

          - &convert gets evaluated only during parsing.

          - A new &convert_back evaluates during composing, providing an
            expression to go the opposite way.

          - Wespecial-cases one &convert case: for
            &convert=<enum-type>($$), the normalizer automatically
            adds a corresponding &convert_back.

  * Adding packer to hilti.

    It's reverse of the unpacker, packing values into binary data:

        target = pack <value> <format>

  * Adding a &hide attribute that will be passed as meta information to
    host applications. spicy-dump respects the &hide attribute.

  * Disabling some debug code output in non-debug builds.

  * Add new tool spicy-dump.

    A variant spicy-driver of spicy-driver that simply prints all parsed
    fields in either ASCII oder JSON (and leaves out all the other ballast
    of spicy-driver).

  * New operators/methods for Spicy.

        bytes.to_time(base)
            Interprets the ``bytes`` as representing a number of seconds
            since the epoch in the form of an ASCII-encoded number and
            converts it into a time value, using a base of *base*. If
            *base* is not given, the default is 10.

        bytes.to_time(byte_order)
           Interprets the ``bytes`` as representing as number of seconds
           since the epoch in the form of an binary number encoded with
           the given byte order, and converts it into a time value.

        enum -> bool
           Enums coerce to boolean, returning true if the value
           corresponds to a known label.

  * Spicy now renders types itself when printing, plus corresponding
    introspection infrastructure.

    Before, Spicy just used standard HILTI rendering for printing out
    values, which led to some not so nice effects, as Spicy's types
    don't always correspond to a HILTI type directly.

    Along with this come a few more pieces/changes:

        - When printing Spicy objects, the output has changed somewhat.
          Apart from making it a bit prettier and simpler, the most
          obvious change is that units now omit printing out any optional
          fields that aren't set.

        - Spicy bitfields now have their own type, rather than just
          being treated as integers. When printing them, all the subfields
          are listed (not just the overall integer value anymore).

        - HILI tuples can now optionally name their elements (which
          internally the bitfields use).

        - A HILTI host application can associate custom run-time type
          information with any HILTI type. We use that for Spicy to
          carry through its type information to the runtime.

        - Further HILTI-level functions for inspecting libhilti RTTI
          (e.g., for tuples and container types).

  * A new libspicy API for introspecting types, so that, e.g., a C
    host application can iterate generically over all fields of a unit
    without prior knowledge of what fields to expect. The Spicy
    rendering code relies fully on this API as well, and not on any
    further knowledge about internals.

  * Splitting out attributes that shouldn't be associated with types into
    better suited classes.

  * Adding %skip-{pre/post} properties.

    This skips a given constant expression before/after any field inside a
    unit.

        # cat skip.spicy
        export type test_pre = unit {
            %skip-pre = / */;

              a: bytes &length=1;
              b: bytes &length=2;
              c: bytes &length=3;
        };

        # printf "   1 23   456"  | spicy-driver skip.spicy
        <a=1,b=23,c=456>

    %skip-pre/post can also be listed globally at the module level, and
    will then be inherited by every unit in there. To disable inside a
    unit, use "%skip-{pre,post} = None".

    Note that the expression given with skip is assumed to represent an
    optional token, which means that effectively it will often only make
    sense to specify a regular expression that also matches an empty
    string. The reason is that it may be hard to predict for the grammar
    writer where exactly the skip gets inserted, as internally it's added
    on a per-field basis, but per production of the generated grammar.

  * Lots of bug fixes and other smaller stuff.


0.3-72 | 2014-10-24 18:11:12 -0700

  * Support for manual backtracking in a Spicy grammar. If a field
    is marked with &try, a later call to self.backtrack() anywhere
    down in the parse tree, will return to that position and continue
    there.

  * When multiple exception handlers are defined in HILTI, choose the
    most specific one.

0.3-70 | 2014-10-24 16:51:21 -0700

  * A new switch variant that dispatches based on look-ahead symbol.

        type A = unit { [...] }
        type B = unit { [...] }
        type C = unit { [...] }

        type test = unit {
            [...]
            switch {
                a: A;
                b: B;
                c: C;
            };
            [...]
        };

    This figures out automatically whether to parse an A, B, or C.

    One can specify a default case as well with the usual "* ->" syntax;
    however, typically one can also just list a case that's a catch-all by
    itself; e.g., a bytes field will act as the default automatically (but
    obviously you can't have more than one of these).

0.3-69 | 2014-10-24 16:37:04 -0700

  * Optional tuple elements for Spicy. If a tuple constructor uses
    the "try attribute" operator (.?) to set one of its elements, the
    type of that element will be become optional<T> (with T being the
    type of the element). The Bro plugin uses this to allow leaving
    record elements unset in *.evt files: when using tuples to
    construct a Bro record, an optional element will transfer over to
    the record accordingly.

  * An "optional" type for Spicy.

        print optional(b"ABC");

  * A set of build system tweaks.

  * Switching implementation of Spicy's switch() statements to use
    unions internally.

  * Adding unions to HILTI.

        - C-style, with names for fields:

            type A = union {
                int<64> i,
                bool b,
                string test
            }

        - C++-variant-style, with anonymous types:

            type A = union<int<64>, bool, string>

    Instructions for the first version:

        union.init A "i" 42  # Instantiate with field set.
        union.get a "i"      # Retrieve field.
        union.is_set "i"     # Test field.

    Instructions for the second version:

        union.init A 42        # Instantiate with type set.
        union.get a            # Get field, target determines type
        union.is_set a int<64> # Test type.

    The unit.init constructor syntax is pretty ugly, better use the
    constructor syntax:

        union<A>(test: "abc")
        union<B>("abc")
        union(test: "abc")
        union("abc")

    Once can dispatch unions based on the current type, similar to how
    switch works:

       local union<int<64>, bool, string> u
       [...]
       dispatch u @default ( (int<64>, @b1), (bool, @b2) )

    Unions also coerce to booleans, yielding true if a value is set.

  * Struct fields can now be marked as "anonymous", meaning that when
    printed an runtime their field name won't be shown. This can
    currently be set internally on the AST node only, it's not exposed
    by the HILTI language.

  * Support for Spicy resynchronizing at marks.

        type test2 = unit {
           %synchronize-at = mark;
           [...]
        }

  * Pac-driver gets an option -m to insert marks into input stream
    (primarily for testing).

  * Two HILTI instructions to set marks in bytes objects.

        bytes.append_mark <b>
            Appends an internal mark at the end of the bytes object <b>.
            The mark is fully transparent to other instructions, and will
            keep its location when more data is appended to the object.

        bytes.next_mark <i>
            Move the bytes iterator i forward to the next mark.

  * Starting to add infrastructure to parse LLVM's stackmaps.
    The code isn't complete yet, and what's there works only on Linux.

  * Switching to delayed reference counting. This is a larger overhaul
    of HILTI's runtime memory management. Rather than generally
    keeping all reference counts up to date all the time (which
    involves a lot of pretty much uncessary operations), we now
    enforce correct reference counts only during explicit
    "safepoints". In between safepoints, HILTI is free to skip
    counting. For now, we trigger safepoints upon entry/exit into
    HILTI (either from/to C, or from/to the thread scheduler), which
    means that we can generally omit all reference counting operations
    for objects that don't persist across these boundaries, including
    for everything on the stack. Included with this come some internal
    changes:

        - Calling conventations have changed to return values at +0
          (instead of +1).

        - Handling of attributes have been unified inside the HILTI
          compiler. Also moving regexp's attributes from type
          information to the values.

        - Heap values can now be "hoisted" to the stack if they don't
          need to persist longer that the stack's lifetime. That
          avoids having to allocate them dynamically. Currently that's
          triggered with a &hoist attribute and works for bytes only;
          however there's no correctness checks in place and must be
          used only if it satisfies all the constraints. Eventually
          HILTI will learn to identify the right situations and apply
          &hoist itself as suitable.

  * hilti-build now disables debugging when optimizions turned on.
    Tests turn on debugging by default now.

  * BACnet updates.
      - Basic readproperty.
      - Implement events for atomicreadfile
      - Fix parsing of bacnet error apdus.
      - Patch to make the bacnet_who_has_request_name actually work.
      - Add support for I-Have, I-Am, Who-Has, Who-Is APDUs including Bro events.
      - Add basic events for all application layer bacnet messages.
      - Test updates and fixes.

  * Port to LLVM 3.5.
